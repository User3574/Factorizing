# Master thesis: Quantum algorithmic techniques for the Shor algorithm
This repo contains code for the Master thesis at VSB - Technical University of Ostrava.
It contains many further codes for other repositories and papers, factorizing numbers 15 and 21 using Shor algorithm.

Further usage includes Microsoft Azure and IBMQ along with D-Wave for factorizing using optimization.
